<h1>
    Problem Solving
</h1>

<p>
    I came across many problems throughout this project, anywhere from as simple </br>
    as putting a break in a paragraph to somewhat more difficult CSS problems such </br>
    as changing colour when hovered over. Usually I solved problems just by trying </br>
    to isolate the issue and find out what part was specifically wrong. Although </br>
    some problems weren't logic problems and were instead problems with the form. </br>
    Many times the closing tags didn't include a '/' and therefore didn't work, I </br>
    didn't realize this and therefore ended up very confused. There were a lot of </br>
    online resources that I used, the most notable being Stack Overflow, W3Schools </br>
    and freeCodeCamp. Stack Overflow is a basic website where any user can ask </br>
    any question, at any level, in any coding language, Although I didn't ask </br>
    any questions I could search through the archives of the previously asked </br>
    questions where people had similar questions and were provided with answers.

    My website's layout was a combination of both these websites, the openness and cleanliness of </br>
    FreeCodeCamp, and also the creativity and popped-outness of Vans, Although the colour scheme </br>
    draws no inspiration from any website and I just believe that the soft pastel palette of the website </br>
    fits the topic quite nicely.

<h1>
    An understanding of web design. Why did I like my website?
</h1>
<p>
    Throughout this project I believe my knowledge and understanding of web design has grown greatly. </br>
    Before this project I knew some small amounts of HTML although my primary focus has always been C# </br>
    I learnt a lot about CSS which I think will be very useful later on as I plan to software developer </br>
    and having the abilities to develop a great website is the first step for that. What do I like about my </br>
    website? First off I think the text that reacts when you hover over it, by changing colour, is a really </br>
    cool aesthetic feature and it springs life into the website. I think the colour scheme of soft pastel </br>
    colours work really well together and they form a very calm and clean learning environment. I think </br>
    people would come to this website if they wish to gain the basic understanding of eggs and their </br>
    relevancy. The fonts work very well together in the website, and the addition of a <u>text shado</u> </br>
    really gives the page more atmosphere, Overall I believe I should receive a level 4 on this project </br>
    I put lots of time into the aesthetic design of the website and flow of the website. The fonts all </br>
    work very well together and I believe this adds a deeper aspect of design to the website. Other than </br>
    that I believe I have met every other requirement on the page
